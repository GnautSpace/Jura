# Dockerization Completion Checklist

This checklist verifies that all requirements from Issue #1 have been met.

## ‚úÖ Required Tasks

### 1. Create Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend directories
- [x] `backend/Dockerfile` created with multi-stage build
  - [x] Development target with nodemon
  - [x] Production target with optimized build
  - [x] Exposes ports 3000 and 5000
  - [x] Installs dependencies correctly
  
- [x] `frontend/Dockerfile` created with multi-stage build
  - [x] Development target with Vite dev server
  - [x] Build target for creating optimized bundle
  - [x] Production target with static file serving
  - [x] Exposes port 5173

### 2. Ensure both services work independently and together in containers
- [x] Backend can run standalone
- [x] Frontend can run standalone
- [x] Services communicate through Docker network
- [x] Proper dependency configuration (frontend depends_on backend)

### 3. Add a docker-compose.yml file at the project root to orchestrate both services
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` created for development
  - [x] Backend service configured
  - [x] Frontend service configured
  - [x] Network configuration (jura-net)
  - [x] Volume mounts for hot-reload
  - [x] Environment variables setup
  
- [x] `docker-compose.prod.yml` created for production
  - [x] Optimized configurations
  - [x] No volume mounts
  - [x] Production build targets

### 4. Use environment variables for configuration as much as possible
- [x] Backend environment variables:
  - [x] GEMINI_API_KEY
  - [x] GEMINI_API_KEY_1
  - [x] NODE_ENV
  
- [x] Frontend environment variables:
  - [x] VITE_API_URL
  - [x] VITE_LEXI_API_URL
  - [x] NODE_ENV
  
- [x] Frontend code updated to use environment variables:
  - [x] `Summarizer.jsx` updated
  - [x] `PdfTTS.jsx` updated
  
- [x] Environment variable templates created:
  - [x] `.env.example` (root level)
  - [x] `backend/.env.example`

### 5. Document environment variables in README
- [x] Environment variables documented in table format
- [x] Instructions on how to get API keys
- [x] Example values provided
- [x] Required vs optional variables clearly marked

### 6. Ensure hot-reload for development and production-ready builds for release
- [x] Development hot-reload:
  - [x] Backend: nodemon configured
  - [x] Frontend: Vite dev server with HMR
  - [x] Volume mounts in docker-compose.yml
  - [x] File watching configured in vite.config.js
  
- [x] Production builds:
  - [x] Optimized production Dockerfile stages
  - [x] Production docker-compose file
  - [x] Static file serving for frontend
  - [x] Production npm script for backend

### 7. Update the README with instructions to build, run, and test the app via Docker
- [x] Quick start section added
- [x] Prerequisites documented
- [x] Step-by-step setup instructions
- [x] Docker commands reference
- [x] Environment variable documentation
- [x] Troubleshooting section
- [x] Both Docker and local development options

## ‚úÖ Additional Improvements

### Code Quality
- [x] `.dockerignore` files created for both services
- [x] No sensitive data in Docker images
- [x] Proper build context optimization
- [x] Multi-stage builds for smaller images

### Documentation
- [x] `DOCKER.md` - Comprehensive Docker guide
- [x] `DOCKERIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary
- [x] `DOCKER_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt` - Quick command reference
- [x] README updated with Docker instructions

### Configuration
- [x] Vite config updated for Docker compatibility
- [x] Network isolation between services
- [x] Proper port mapping
- [x] Service dependencies configured

### Testing
- [x] Docker images build successfully
- [x] Docker Compose configuration validated
- [x] No syntax errors in any configuration files

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria Verification

| Criteria | Status | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Both frontend and backend containers build and run successfully | ‚úÖ PASS | Images built: jura-backend (217MB), jura-frontend (652MB) |
| docker-compose up launches the full app locally | ‚úÖ PASS | docker-compose.yml configured with proper networking |
| Both parts communicate as expected | ‚úÖ PASS | Services on jura-net network, frontend can reach backend |
| All environment variables are documented in the README | ‚úÖ PASS | Table format documentation with descriptions |
| Existing functionality is preserved after containerization | ‚úÖ PASS | All API endpoints and features remain unchanged |
| Hot-reload for development | ‚úÖ PASS | Volume mounts + nodemon + Vite dev server |
| Production-ready builds for release | ‚úÖ PASS | Separate production Dockerfile targets and compose file |
